			Interaction description:
			<br>	
			In recent years, the Nanjing government and people's awareness of environmental protection has increased, and the requirements for the next generation of environmental protection education are even higher. As a part of the ecological chain of the Zijin Mountain, butterflies are part of the ecological sensitivity of the butterfly. The butterfly shows the distribution of vegetation in the Purple Mountain, which promotes children's awareness of environmental protection.</p>

			The yellow hook butterfly usually dances in low and short plants, and the larva feeds on the yarrow of the cannabis family, which is easier to catch. The pupa of the yellow hook butterfly is a hanging pupa.
			When the last batch of pupa feathering in late autumn, the yellow hook butterfly will overwinter as an adult, usually hiding under a wall gap or stone. When the weather warms up, come out and bask in the sun.

			<p>The cat butterfly belongs to Lepidoptera, and the parasitic plants are saplings such as Ulmus spp. It can be used as ecological indicator species in central and eastern China.
			<br>
			Feeding on the young leaves of the hackberry tree or the new shoots of the roots, the effects of its larvae on the host plants are in a state of "harmless insects". Reduced visits to nectar-producing plants and overloaded belief that activities have an important impact on their survival.

			<p>Citrus Papilio occurs 3 generations a year and overwinters with pupae. The hatched larvae eat the egg shell first, and then the buds and young leaves. As the larvae age, they gradually feed on the growing leaves.
			<br>
			The host is the citrus of Rutaaceae, Zanthoxylum bungeanum, Zanthoxylum bungeanum, Evodia, Cork, Citrus and other plants. Adults often appear in open fields or sparse forests, often absorbing water in wetlands or collecting honey between flowers.

			<p>The swallowtail butterfly is a large butterfly in the genus Papilioidae of the Lepidoptera family, without any subspecies. Larvae feed on plants of the family Rutaceae. Adults like to suck nectar. This species has a large number, often seen in forests, valley edges and gardens, and fly to wildflowers in the morning and dusk to suck honey.
			<br>
            The host of the larva is a plant of the family Rutaceae, whose staple foods are Changshan, Tangerine, and Ruta. The male butterfly has a strong ability to fly, its speed is fast, and it often flies for a long time; the female butterfly flies slowly and likes to glide.

			<p>The Chinese tiger swallowtail butterfly likes to live in the foresedge where the light is strong and the humidity is not too high. The flying ability is not strong. It does not have the habit of flying over the hillside along the slopes of other swallowtail butterflies, so it is only in a specific narrow area activity. 
			<br>
			It belongs to the narrow-eating animal. The nectar plants that are frequently visited are mainly dandelion, purple flower and other Violaceae plants. They also fly into the field to suck canola or broad bean nectar. Perched in the undergrowth of low-lying swamps before and after sunset

			Citrus green swallowtail butterflies like to visit flowers. Male butterflies will collectively absorb water in the valley wetland. The host plant is camphor tree, and the larvae have the habit of feeding egg shells. The young leaves of the camphor tree are eaten immediately after eating, which will endanger the growth of the camphor tree.
            <br>
            Four generations occur a year, and wintering with crickets.

		    The cabbage white butterfly, also known as the cabbage white butterfly, is also known as the cabbage worm, and it is the most widespread and most harmful pest in China.
            The known host plants are as many as 9 families and 35, and they are credible for cruciferous plants, especially for thick-leafed cabbage, cauliflower, cabbage, radish, etc.
